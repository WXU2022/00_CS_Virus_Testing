% - each run of this script will perform decoding from pooled results for
% one virus type, one trial, and one pooling matrix. Pooling results from
% multiple stage can be combined to improve the decoding results in each
% run. Original implementation supports multiple trials
% - each independent experiment contains results from the {stage 1, stage 2, ...} if adaptive request decoding is
% performed; 
% - totally 2 independent trial experiments are conducted for
% MHV-1; totally 1 independent trial experiment is done for COVID-19
% - use the results from the first n stages for decoding;
